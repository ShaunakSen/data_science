# RF is used for classification problem
# It is a supervised learning model
# spam classifier: what params does it look for?
# subject line, text, html tags, ip addr of source etc.

# Types of Classifiers: Decision Tree, Random Forests and Naive Bayes

# RF is an ensemble classifier made from many DT models
# ensemble methods use multiple ML algos to get better predictive perf

# ENtire dataset is split into 3 subsets
# each subset leads to a DT
# we have 3 DT and each DT leads to a certain outcome
# RF compiles results from all the DTS and then leads to a final outcome


# Bayes: describes prob of event based on certain prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to that event

# eg: cancer related to age.. age can be used to accurately assess prob of having cancer

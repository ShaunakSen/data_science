# Data Mining
# --------------------------------------------------

# Structure of Data

# img src = img/Capture1

# eg of semi structured data is XML

# Quasi Struc - neither has rigid structure nor a noticeable pattern. But with a bit of tweaking, info can be extracted
# Unstructured - no inherent data format. Very diff to extract info

# Data Mining : It is the computing process of discovering patterns in large datasets involving methods at the
# intersection of ML, stats and database systems

# img src = img/Capture2


# Data Mining is applying of intelligent operations such as clustering, classification, regression in order to extract patterns

# Data Mining Techniques

# img src = img/Capture3

# Anomaly Detection: Identification of unusual patterns, outliers which help us in understanding the variation in data

# we have to do some sort of processing on the outliers before analysis

# Association Rule Mining: Also referred to as market basket analysis, this method is used for discovering interesting
# association patterns among vars

# eg: Beer - Diaper Syndrome: In a survey it was found Whenever a single father came to store to buy diaper, its very likely he buys beer
# This is quite strange, but was found out using Association Rule Mining
# This is also basis of many Recommender Systems
# U watch FRIENDS on Netflix; it suggests u BBT and HIMYM. All of these belong to Comedy Genre 

# Clustering: Done on basis of high intra-cluster similarity
# It comes under Unsupervised Learning

# Unsupervised Learning: we do not have pre defined labels; even then the algo is able to cluster them

# Classification: Comes under Supervised Learning

# we hhave pre defined labels

# Regression: How does one var change wrt another var
# comes under supervised learning
